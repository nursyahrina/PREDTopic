This app is designed to help you explore and understand the research landscape in Computer Science. It provides a range of features to help you analyze topics, trends, and key terms associated with different research areas.

### Application Layout

PREDTopic is designed with a user-friendly layout that is divided into two main sections:

1. **Main Section**
   
   This is the primary display area of the application where all visualizations and key features are shown. It includes the default display of the **Top Topic**, **Trend Visualization**, **Top 10 Words**, **Topic Wordcloud**, **Topic Description**, and **Top 10 Representative Documents**. You will also find the controls to select different topic models and topics here. By default, this section shows data related to the **Top Topic**, which is the topic with the highest average number of articles over the last ten years.

2. **Sidebar**
   
   Located on the side, the sidebar contains the **Predict Research Idea** tool. Here, you can enter a description of your research idea or an initial abstract. The sidebar also includes two buttons: "LDA" and "BERTopic," which allow you to predict the relevant topic based on your input text using the selected model.
