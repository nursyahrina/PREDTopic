6. **Top 10 Representative Documents**
   
   This feature lists the top 10 documents that best match the selected topic, providing titles, abstracts, publication years, and DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers). The titles and DOIs are clickable, taking you directly to the research articles.


7. **Select Topic Model**
   
   In the top right corner of the interface, you'll find an option to choose between the LDA and BERTopic models. The default is set to the model with the highest coherence score from our evaluation. The model you choose will influence all the data and visualizations you see.


8. **Select Topic**
   
   This feature lets you pick a different topic from a dropdown menu, allowing you to explore various research areas. The options will depend on the topic model youâ€™ve selected.


9. **Predict Research Idea**
   
   You can enter a research idea or a draft abstract into the provided text box. By clicking the "LDA" or "BERTopic" buttons, the application will predict the most relevant topic based on your input. This is particularly handy for aligning your work with existing research trends.
